# light_theme
A lightweight theme for Windows 10.

Taskbar_Transparency.reg disables taskbar transparency and also fixes a small wireframe bug around the System Tray.

Unfortunately a fix does not yet exist for fixing the wireframes around other system menus, such as the Antion Centre and Search Bar.  If you have a potential fix submit an issue.
